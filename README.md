## Description

Here, I add the codes related to posts in imspecies [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/____imspecies/) page and [website](https://www.imspecies.com/). The module names are similar to the post names. I will keep the codes simple and write them to help you understand the specufic subject exiplained in the related post. Therefore, every induvidual code might not be executable and might only be written for learning purposes.
